Jun 1, 2012: version 2.8.0

    * UFconfig replaced with SuiteSparse_config

Dec 7, 2011: version 2.7.4

    * fixed the Makefile to better align with CFLAGS and other standards

Jan 25, 2011: version 2.7.3

    * minor fix to "make install"

Nov 30, 2009: version 2.7.2

    * added "make install" and "make uninstall"

May 31, 2007: version 2.7.0

    * ported to 64-bit MATLAB

    * subdirectories added (Source/, Include/, Lib/, Doc/, MATLAB/, Demo/)

Dec 12, 2006, version 2.5.2

    * minor MATLAB cleanup.  MATLAB functions renamed colamd2 and symamd2,
	so that they do not conflict with the built-in versions.  Note that
	the MATLAB built-in functions colamd and symamd are identical to
	the colamd and symamd functions here.

Aug 31, 2006: Version 2.5.1

    * minor change to colamd.m and symamd.m, to use etree instead
	of sparsfun.

Apr. 30, 2006: Version 2.5

    * colamd_recommended modified, to do more careful integer overflow
	checking.  It now returns size_t, not int.  colamd_l_recommended
	also returns size_t.  A zero is returned if an error occurs.  A
	postive return value denotes success.  In v2.4 and earlier,
	-1 was returned on error (an int or long).

    * long replaced with UF_long integer, which is long except on WIN64.

Nov 15, 2005:

    * minor editting of comments; version number (2.4) unchanged.

Changes from Version 2.3 to 2.4 (Aug 30, 2005)

    * Makefile now relies on ../UFconfig/UFconfig.mk

    * changed the dense row/col detection.  The meaning of the knobs
	has thus changed.

    * added an option to turn off aggressive absorption.  It was
	always on in versions 2.3 and earlier.

    * added a #define'd version number

    * added a function pointer (colamd_printf) for COLAMD's printing.

    * added a -DNPRINT option, to turn off printing at compile-time.

    * added a check for integer overflow in colamd_recommended

    * minor changes to allow for more simpler 100% test coverage

    * bug fix.  If symamd v2.3 fails to allocate its copy of the input
	matrix, then it erroneously frees a calloc'd workspace twice.
	This bug has no effect on the MATLAB symamd mexFunction, since
	mxCalloc terminates the mexFunction if it fails to allocate
	memory.  Similarly, UMFPACK is not affected because it does not
	use symamd.  The bug has no effect on the colamd ordering
	routine in v2.3.

Changes from Version 2.2 to 2.3 (Sept. 8, 2003)

    * removed the call to the MATLAB spparms ('spumoni') function.
	This can take a lot of time if you are ordering many small
	matrices.  Only affects the MATLAB interface (colamdmex.c,
	symamdmex.c, colamdtestmex.c, and symamdtestmex.c).  The
	usage of the optional 2nd argument to the colamd and symamd
	mexFunctions was changed accordingly.

Changes from Version 2.1 to 2.2 (Sept. 23, 2002)

    * extensive testing routines added (colamd_test.m, colamdtestmex.c,
	and symamdtestmex.c), and the Makefile modified accordingly.

    * a few typos in the comments corrected 

    * use of the MATLAB "flops" command removed from colamd_demo, and an
	m-file routine luflops.m added.

    * an explicit typecast from unsigned to int added, for COLAMD_C and
	COLAMD_R in colamd.h.

    * #include <stdio.h> added to colamd_example.c


Changes from Version 2.0 to 2.1 (May 4, 2001)

    * TRUE and FALSE are predefined on some systems, so they are defined
	    here only if not already defined.
    
    * web site changed

    * UNIX Makefile modified, to handle the case if "." is not in your path.


Changes from Version 1.0 to 2.0 (January 31, 2000)

    No bugs were found in version 1.1.  These changes merely add new
    functionality.

    * added the COLAMD_RECOMMENDED (nnz, n_row, n_col) macro.

    * moved the output statistics, from A, to a separate output argument.
	    The arguments changed for the C-callable routines.

    * added colamd_report and symamd_report.

    * added a C-callable symamd routine.  Formerly, symamd was only
	    available as a mexFunction from MATLAB.

    * added error-checking to symamd.  Formerly, it assumed its input
	    was error-free.

    * added the optional stats and knobs arguments to the symamd mexFunction

    * deleted colamd_help.  A help message is still available from
	    "help colamd" and "help symamd" in MATLAB.

    * deleted colamdtree.m and symamdtree.m.  Now, colamd.m and symamd.m
	    also do the elimination tree post-ordering.  The Version 1.1
	    colamd and symamd mexFunctions, which do not do the post-
	    ordering, are now visible as colamdmex and symamdmex from
	    MATLAB.  Essentialy, the post-ordering is now the default
	    behavior of colamd.m and symamd.m, to match the behavior of
	    colmmd and symmmd.  The post-ordering is only available in the
	    MATLAB interface, not the C-callable interface.

    * made a slight change to the dense row/column detection in symamd,
	    to match the stated specifications.
